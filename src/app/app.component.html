                A little over 15 years ago, Brittany and Noran made the winding journey up the mountain to attend Appalachian State
                University. Unbeknownst to the two of them, they moved into their dorm rooms only one floor apart. One day, Brittany's floor
                decided to organize a movie night and posted flyers in the elevator inviting anyone in the dorm who wanted to come. What was
                the movie they chose you ask? A lovely and totally appropriate film from 2007 called SuperBad. Out of an entire 8-floor dorm
                building, Noran was the only person with enough gumption to attend a movie night full of strangers. There, the two of them
                became fast friends. Over the next decade and a half, there would continue to be numerous adventures, countless new things
                to learn about one another, and many more movie nights. All of you have been a part of our unforgettable journey, and we
                would like to thank you for celebrating this new chapter of our lives with us. &lt;3
